# From Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning
Final project on enron data POIs need to be predicted. Dataset is small with a little over 100 records. We have an imbalanced classification problem at hand, POIs make up only a small part of the dataset.

Applied standard techniques including model selection, outlier removals, gridsearch etc. with cross validation. In the first upload I did not use any oversampling techniques.

first upload: 0.5 f1 score


Update: tried out oversampling techniques and with borderlineSMOTE I found a gem for this dataset:

f1 score of 0.977. 

Really had a lot of fun and learned a lot while working on this dataset! Comments welcome

Done with spyder 3.3.1
